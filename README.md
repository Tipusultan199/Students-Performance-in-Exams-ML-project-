# Students-Performance-in-Exams-ML-project-

In the Students' Performance in Exams ML Project, the goal is to analyze how various factors influence students' test scores. The project explores the relationship between test scores and variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course.

The dataset used for this project consists of 1000 rows and 8 columns. It can be obtained from the following source: Dataset Source - Kaggle.

To begin the project, the problem statement is defined, which aims to understand the impact of different variables on students' test scores. The subsequent steps of the machine learning project life cycle are followed:

Understanding the Problem Statement: The project focuses on identifying the factors that influence students' test scores and aims to create a predictive model.

Data Collection: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of 1000 rows and 8 columns. It provides information about students' demographic and background characteristics, as well as their test scores.

Data Checks to Perform: Before proceeding with analysis, it is important to perform data checks to ensure data quality, handle missing values, and address any inconsistencies in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is explored to gain insights and understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the variables. Visualizations and statistical techniques are utilized to analyze the data.

Data Pre-Processing: This step involves preparing the data for model training. It includes handling categorical variables, encoding them appropriately, and performing feature scaling or normalization if necessary.

Model Training: Machine learning models are trained using the pre-processed dataset. Various algorithms can be applied, such as linear regression, decision trees, or support vector machines, to predict students' test scores based on the given variables.

Choosing the Best Model: The trained models are evaluated and compared based on evaluation metrics such as mean squared error or accuracy. The model with the best performance is selected for further analysis and interpretation.

By following this machine learning project life cycle, the Students' Performance in Exams ML Project aims to gain insights into the factors affecting students' test scores and develop a predictive model that can provide valuable insights for educational institutions and stakeholders.
